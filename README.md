# StretchyHeader 🚀

Welcome to the StretchyHeader repository! This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how to create a stretchy header in iOS using UICollectionView. 📱💻

## Overview 📝

The StretchyHeader project demonstrates how to create a stretchy header in UICollectionView, where the header image scales proportionally as you scroll down the collection view. The effect is a visually stunning and engaging user experience, that can be incorporated into various types of iOS apps. 💫💥

The sample project includes the following features:

- A collection view with a stretchy header 🧮🔍
- The ability to customize the background color of the header 🎨🖌️
- A selection of images to choose from for the header 📷🌅
- A demo of the stretchy header in action 🎥👀

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the StretchyHeader project, simply clone this repository and open the project in Xcode. The project is written in Swift and requires Xcode 12 or later. 🛠️💻

## Usage 🤖

To use the StretchyHeader project in your own iOS app, simply copy the `StretchyHeaderCollectionViewLayout.swift` file into your project and update the `collectionViewLayout` property of your UICollectionView to an instance of `StretchyHeaderCollectionViewLayout`. 📝📈

```swift
let layout = StretchyHeaderCollectionViewLayout()
collectionView.collectionViewLayout = layout
```

You can then customize the header image and background color as desired using the headerImageView and backgroundColor properties of the StretchyHeaderCollectionViewLayout class. 🎨📷


```swift
layout.headerImageView.image = UIImage(named: "headerImage")
layout.backgroundColor = .systemBackground
```
